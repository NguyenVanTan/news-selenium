"# quikcstart-selenium" 
This sample application shows how to use Selenium ((http://www.seleniumhq.org/)) with Java. This application autamates the google search using Selenium. The sole purpose of this application is to provide a working copy of code. So, if you are a beginner for Seleniumm it will provide you the bsae (with all necessary setup). 
It's a maven project and pretty simple to quickstart selenium. 
This sample program has 2 clasess (one for chrome and other for Firefox browser). The testcase is written for Chrome browser. But you can explore and write whatever testcases you want to write for your application.  

# Prerequisites  
jdk 8  (lower version is also ok)
chrome (default test browser) /Firefox browser  
Maven v3.2.5  

# Steps to run the application  
(1) Install JDK 8 if not already installed. It can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html. Follow the installation insrtuction.  
(2) set your JAVA_HONE, if not already set. Here is an example on how to set it https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2619584/how-to-set-java-home-on-windows-7  
(3) Install/setup maven. Here is a nice example https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/  
(4) Download/clone the project to your local system  
(5) Go to the project root and run mvn clean install. It does following things:  
(a)Compiles andd packcages the project.  
(b) runs the testcases. This application has a test case which will automatically do google search using Selenium.  
For your conveneince I've added a Java Class(TestFirstSikuli) with main method. You can run this class also to test the application.  
(6) Your all set with basic Sikuli. Go ahead and explore more on it. Happy Learning !
